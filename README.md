# Project Title
Eyes For You

A site that only has eyes for you and tracks the movement of your mouse.

## Description

Ready for the ultimate staring contest? “Eyes for You” is the answer! With a pair of googly 
eyes in the middle of the screen, these peepers will follow your every move. Sometimes words 
just aren’t enough and it’s best to just let the eyes do all the talking.
